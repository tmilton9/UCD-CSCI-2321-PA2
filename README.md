This is the Read me for PA2


this program combines a point class and a cluster class together in a clustering name space

the point class is implemented with pointers to arrays of variable dimention on the heap that are dynamically created

the cluster class is a link listed collection of points to be used in sorting at a later time

both classes contain overloaded operatiors to facilitate the manipulation of the points and their grouping during later projects
